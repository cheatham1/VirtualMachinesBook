# Virtual machine book for VM versions M, L and N

You will learn how to download and prepare a virtual machine to run on your computer.  This will then enable you to take a look at ATLAS data.

## What is a virtual machine ?

A virtual machine will transform your computer into an analysis machine!

Your physical computer will be the "host", while the virtual machine will be a "guest". Most of the guest code runs unmodified, directly on the host computer, and the guest operating system "thinks" it's running on a real machine.

A virtual machine allows an unmodified operating system with all of its installed software to run in a special environment, on top of your existing operating system. 


There are two steps to setup your environment
1. Get and prepare VirtualBox.  This is explained in the next two chapters.
2. Get and run a virtual machine.  This is explained in the following two chapters.
