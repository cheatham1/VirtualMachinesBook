# Get and Run the Virtual Machine


## Getting the Virtual-Machine-Scientific-Linux-6.7 ( **VM-SL6.7** ) with the **ATLAS Data & Tools Software and Samples**



In order to obtain the **VDI** file of our **VM-SL6.7**, we need to be sure that our host system has space for that.  At least **30GB** of space should be reserved for this.

To download the compressed file just [[https://arturos.web.cern.ch/arturos/ATLAS/outreach/vm/OutReach/vm/ScientificLinux67_ATLAS_Outreach_Tutorial_CERN_2016-disk1.vdi.gz]
[click here]].

You can use the "[[https://arturos.web.cern.ch/arturos/ATLAS/outreach/vm/OutReach/vm/][window]]" below to get the **VM-SL6.7**

You can directly select the option of **Open** the file if you have it:

You will see on the right the **Hard Disk** and a small icon of a _hard disk_ where if you click there, the system will give you two options. You have to select: **Choose a virtual hard disk file...**
